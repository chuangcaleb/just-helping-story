### The Inciting Incident

EXT. SIDEWALK - CONTINUOUS

The Figure takes his first step, but suddenly we hear the jangling of CHIMES. He spins to look â€” no, the chimes of the jewelry store were not moving.

He cranes his head all around. NOTHING. No one. But the sound was getting CLOSER.

He TENSES up, eyes scanning up and down the road, ready to fight or flight.

WREEEKKK!!

The Figure TWISTS around towards the sound, but gets caught by a POTHOLE.
